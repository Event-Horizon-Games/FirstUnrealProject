# My First Unreal Project
 Followed block breaker tutorial to make an unreal game.
 
 All credit to [this guide](https://www.raywenderlich.com/32435756-how-to-create-a-simple-fps-in-unreal-engine-5) for all the assets and teaching. Literally was not possible without the guide. Highly recommend anyone seeing this to simply go there and follow the guide for yourself.
